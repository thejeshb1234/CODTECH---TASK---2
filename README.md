Overview: Functional Testing with Selenium WebDriver
Objective: The goal of this project is to automate the testing of a web application using Selenium WebDriver. Selenium allows you to simulate user interactions with a web application, ensuring it behaves as expected. This helps identify functional issues in the application across different browsers.

Key Concepts
Functional Testing: Verifies that the application functions as expected (e.g., login, form submission, navigation).
Selenium WebDriver: A tool for automating web browser interaction. It allows you to write scripts that interact with web pages and perform user actions, such as clicking buttons or entering text.
Cross-Browser Testing: Selenium WebDriver supports running tests in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.), ensuring consistency across environments.
Steps in the Project
Set up Selenium WebDriver:

Install Selenium and WebDriver for your preferred browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome, GeckoDriver for Firefox).
Configure WebDriver to interact with the browser of choice.
Write Test Scripts:

Automate user interactions such as clicking buttons, entering text, navigating between pages, and verifying content.
Example test cases could include:
Logging in with valid credentials.
Submitting a contact form.
Verifying that a user is redirected after successful login.
Run Tests on Different Browsers:

Write scripts that can run on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
WebDriver provides the ability to switch between browsers by initializing different WebDriver instances.
Test Automation Framework:

Integrate with tools like TestNG or JUnit to organize and execute tests.
Use Page Object Model (POM) for maintainable and reusable code.
Implement assertions to verify that the expected outcomes match the actual results.


Summary:
Functional Testing with Selenium WebDriver
The objective of this project is to automate the functional testing of a web application using Selenium WebDriver. Selenium enables you to simulate user interactions (e.g., clicking buttons, entering text, navigating) with a web application to verify that it behaves as expected. By automating these interactions, Selenium helps identify functional issues in the application and ensures that it works correctly across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.). This approach improves testing efficiency, consistency, and cross-browser compatibility.
